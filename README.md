# VR
This repository contains coursework from the Virtual Reality (VR) course at University.

## 1. Ray Tracing
The first half of the course focused on learning the fundamentals of VR, specifically the ray tracing algorithm and its implementation in C#.

This repository includes implementations of both a [basic ray tracing](https://github.com/tiutcristian/VR_raytracing/) algorithm and an [advanced version](https://github.com/tiutcristian/RayTracingWithRotations) utilizing quaternions.

## 2. Unity Project
The second half of the course involved creating a VR application using Unity. The project aimed to develop an interactive VR experience, helping users heal from social anxiety through guided social interactions in a virtual environment.
